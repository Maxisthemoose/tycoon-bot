- Once reaching set levels you can choose to perstige and unlock a special recipie or a special item to sell in your shop that makes a good amount of money. 

# Shops
- You have a shop that has workers
- The more workers you have the faster you can make money
- If you have 3 workers it takes 15 mins before the shop is "maxed out" and won't make any more money till claimed.
- Each worker can be claimed at 5 mins.
- Boosters, multipliers, and other items can effect this rate.

# Future Ideas
- When you reach set level you will be able to create a franchise or sell your shop (to be determined).
- Once in a franchise you unlock new items to be bought and other special perks. An example could be you can work more with a lower cool down.
